"Previously, we saw how to use ``chemotools`` in combination with "
"``scikit-learn`` to preprocess your data and make predictions. However, "
"in a real-world scenario, we would like to persist our trained (fitted) "
"pipelines to deploy it to a production environment. In this section, we "
"will show two ways to persist our models:"

"``pickle`` is a Python module that implements a binary protocol for "
"serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. It is a "

"``joblib`` is a Python module that provides utilities for saving and "
