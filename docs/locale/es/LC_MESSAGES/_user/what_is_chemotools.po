"``chemotools`` is an open-source Python package for spectral "
"preprocessing and chemometric modelling. It integrates directly with the "
"``scikit-learn`` ecosystem, enabling reproducible and scalable "

"Spectroscopy is diverse — different **instruments**, **sample matrices**,"
" and **analysis goals** demand different approaches. ``chemotools`` "
"provides a **focused set of transformers** for spectroscopic data and "
"makes it simple to assemble them into **preprocessing pipelines**. By "
"connecting to the wider **Python ecosystem**, you can leverage **state-"
"of-the-art machine learning** and **scientific libraries** to build "
"**robust, end-to-end spectroscopic models**."

"``chemotools`` transforms preprocessing into a **modular, composable "
"process**: each transformer follows the ``fit`` / ``transform`` API and "

" adapters required."
