API Reference
=============

The public Python API for ``chemotools``. Everything below is generated automatically
using ``autosummary`` + ``autodoc``. Submodules and objects are expanded recursively.

.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated
    :recursive:
    :caption: Top-level package
    :hidden:

    chemotools

.. note:: The pages under ``generated/`` are auto-created at build time; you normally
            should not add them to version control.
